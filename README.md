# Inventory management system

## A system that manages remaining stocks of a business as well as many functions that can facilitate business owners running their companies.





This **inventory management system** is built taking into account various situations that can occur in businesses especially in E-Commerce field.
The program will help not just control the number of an item in stock as a whole, but check and control individual products belonging to those items.
Along with its basic features for managing inventory, the program will also make sure only certain people with registered login accounts access the application.

To briefly mention why I chose this project, I was looking for a project that can be helpful in real life. And also, the fact that the designs of this type of programs 
require object-oriented programming as an inventory management system needs to take care of quantities of items in stock, while relying on other objects 
that take care of  individual products, is another factor that interested me in this project.
